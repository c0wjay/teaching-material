## Building

We use https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] for slides and assignments.

To compile `.adoc` to HTML, you need to have Ruby and https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler[bundler].
Using https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[`rbenv`] for project-local ruby package installation is recommended.

We use https://mermaid-js.github.io/[Mermaid.js] for diagrams in slides. It requres Node installed. You can use https://github.com/Schniz/fnm[`fnm`] to manage Node versions.
