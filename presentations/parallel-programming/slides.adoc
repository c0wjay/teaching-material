== Overview

There's parallelism at every level of the computer stack:
- Intra/Super Word Parallelism in assembly
- Pipelining
- SIMD instructions
- cores hyper threading I/O
- CPUs and GPUs
- Multiple cores on the same computer
- Many computers connected on a network

== Parallel Programming in Rust
Parallelism here means *different cores* can work towards solving the *same problem*
at the same time.

We will focus on splitting the work across multiple cores on the same computer.
